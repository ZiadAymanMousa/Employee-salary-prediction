# Employee-salary-prediction my first practice in machine learning  
This is a Python script that processes an employee dataset to predict their salaries using various models. The script imports necessary
libraries such as numpy, pandas, and sklearn, and preprocesses the data using techniques such as label encoding, dropping low-correlation
columns, and scaling the data to minimize the difference between big and small values. The script then uses several models, including logistic
regression, GaussianNB, SVC, KNeighbors, and random forest, to predict the salaries of employees based on the preprocessed data.
Finally, the script outputs the accuracy percentages of each model for further analysis. Overall, this script demonstrates how to perform data
preprocessing and use different models to predict employee salaries.
